  <h1>Connect to Stripe</h1>

<p>
    To allow FundIt to collection donations on your behalf, you
    need to connect FundIt to a Stripe account. Stripe is a
    secure payment processor, similar to PayPal. Stripe will
    deposit funds donated to your organization directly to your
    bank account. If you don't have a Stripe account, you'll be
    prompted to crate one.
